Change log for RPilot
---------------------

1.4.2 (Released June 21st, 2002)
 - Fix usage of `isblank()', a GNU extension (Thanks to Patrick Eaton)
 - Add some #defines to rpilot.h to replace a few hard-coded constants
 - RPilot is over 4 years old. Wow.

1.4.1 (Released August 13th, 2000)
 - New math system!  I think that was the only remaining code from the 1.0 
   releases, so the 1.4 versions now represent a complete rewrite.
 - Added Unix man page.
 - First version to use RPM and BSD packages.

1.4: (Released July 4th, 2000)
 - Rewrote everything except the math system (which needs it bad!)
 - Merged parse.c and rstring.c
 - Fixed a few examples.
 - Added an interactive mode.
 - Added the special variables $prompt, #rpilot, and #retcode
 - Revised documentation.
 - Changed contact info in all files.

1.01: (Released July 4th, 1998)
 - Fixed two bugs in rpilot.c, so it will now work when compiled by gcc.  The
   lines read "strcpy( string, '\0')" when that should have been
   "strset( string, 0)".  Thanks to Ken M who pointed this out.
 - Fixed a few bugs in parse.c - see that file for more info.
 - Revised documentation to point out differences in the size of numbers based
   on what compiler the program was compiled with, and correct a few typos.
 - Added a new example program, fact.p, for calculating factorials.
 - Included a DJGPP-compiled version of RPilot in the DOS distribution.
 - Released the first native OS/2 version.
 - Added this file.

1.0: (Released Apr 17th, 1998)
 - First version for DOS and Linux.
